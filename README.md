# Stripe Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for integrating Stripe with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) as the backend framework. 
This setup includes basic configurations for managing Stripe payments in a Hono-based environment, making it easy to build and deploy a server that handles payment processing with Stripe.

It is based on [FireShip.io](https://fireship.io) course.

## Features

- **Stripe Integration**: Easily connect your Hono app to Stripe for payment processing.
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Includes sample endpoints for creating and managing payments.
- **Environment Configuration**: Securely configure your Stripe API keys and other environment variables.
- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation of concerns to make customization straightforward.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** version 20 or higher
- **Stripe Account**: Set up a [Stripe account](https://stripe.com) and get your API keys.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stripe-hono-boilerplate.git
cd stripe-hono-boilerplate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages with:

'''bash
npm install
'''

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Stripe secret and publishable keys:

'''plaintext
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
'''

### 4. Run the Server
Start the Hono server:

'''bash
npm start
'''

Your server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

### Sample Endpoints
Create Payment Intent: /api/payment_intents/create
Creates a new payment intent with Stripe.

Retrieve Payment Intent: /api/payment_intents/:id
Retrieves a payment intent by its ID.

### Example Requests
Here’s an example request to create a payment intent:

'''bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payment_intents/create \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "usd"
}'
'''

## Customization
